# Speech To Life Plugin

Speech To Life is a voice recognition plugin for Unreal Engine which gives you performant offline voice recognition for Windows and Android platforms. It includes a sentence fuzzy matching library to allow conversation selection like gameplay and easily supports voice command control found in games where your voice causes actions/events to occur in the game world. This can be a very powerful mechanic in VR games where it adds an extra layer of 'presence'.

Some examples of usage:

* Choose dialog choices with NPCs using your voice
* Have NPCs react to things you say, give commands
* Ghost hunting game questions to the ghost to get responses / make the ghost do things.
* Add an extra layer of controls for VR/AR applications

Speech To Life can support over 20 languages using the exceptional voice recognition supplied by Vosk.

The plugin can be simply implemented into your own project and contains a fully working example found [here](https://github.com/SolarStormInteractive/SpeechToLife_Example/releases).
